Graph : Non Linear data structure with set of nodes which connected by edge
- Undirected Graph - bidirectional edge - cyclic
- Directed Graph - unidirectional edge - not cyclic

cyclic : start at point A to end at point A
if graph is cyclic -> enclosed graph

path : distance from one node to another -> same node cannot appear twice in a path

Degree of undirected graph : number of edges connecting the node
Degree of Directed graph :
InDegree - Edges coming in
OutDegree - Edges going out

## Total Degree Of Graph == 2 * Edges

Edge Weight => Weight of Edge

## Undirected Graph
Input :
N = Number of nodes = 5
M = Number of Edges = 6

Edges are given
1, 2
1, 3
2, 4
3, 4
2, 5
4, 5

Output:
2 ways to store graphs
1. Matrix
2. Adjacency List

Matrix Way
Mark edge as 1 for two connecting nodes
for ex.
1, 2
1, 3
2, 4
3, 4
2, 5
4, 5

If graph starts with 1-based index, then create matrix of N+1 size (since array is 0-based)
adjacent[n+1][n+1]

0   1   2   3   4   5

1       1   1

2   1           1   1

3   1           1

4       1   1       1
5       1       1

1 => represents edge between two nodes
0 => represents no edge

Space Complexity => (n+1) * (n+1) => O(n2) : Not Optimal

Adjacency List Way : Why = Optimal Space Complexity
For 1 based indexed graph => create list of size (n+1)
0 - empty list
1 - empty list
2 - empty list
3 - empty list
4 - empty list
5 - empty list

List<ArrayListM<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();
1, 2
1, 3
2, 4
3, 4
2, 5
4, 5

0 - empty list
1 - {2, 3}                  = 2
2 - {1, 4, 5}               = 3
3 - {1, 4}                  = 2
4 - {2, 3, 5}               = 3
5 - {2, 4}                  = 2
                            = Total : 12 or 2 * Edges

Since one edge connects two nodes => we consider mark edge twice
1 --- 2 and 2 ---- 1
Space Complexity => O(2*M) => 2 * Edges
