const name = 'Lydia';

console.log(name());        // TypeError: name is not a function

/*
The variable name holds the value of a string, which is not a function, and thus cannot be invoked.

TypeErrors get thrown when a value is not of the expected type. JavaScript expected name to be a function since we're trying to invoke it. It was a string however, so a TypeError gets thrown: name is not a function!

SyntaxErrors get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript, for example when you've written the word return as retrun. ReferenceErrors get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.
