/*
First, we invoke the slice method on the fruit array. The slice method does not modify the original array, but returns the value that it sliced off the array: the banana emoji. Then, we invoke the splice method on the fruit array. The splice method does modify the original array, which means that the fruit array now consists of ['🍊', '🍎']. At last, we invoke the unshift method on the fruit array, which modifies the original array by adding the provided value, ‘🍇’ in this case, as the first element in the array. The fruit array now consists of ['🍇', '🍊', '🍎'].
