/*
Output: Third

The Promise.all method runs the passed promises in parallel. If one promise fails, the Promise.all method rejects with the value of the rejected promise. In this case, promise3 is rejected with the value "Third". Weâ€™re catching the rejected value in the chained catch method on the runPromises invocation to catch any errors within the runPromises function. Only "Third" gets logged, since promise3 is rejected with this value.
